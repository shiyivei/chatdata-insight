You are asked to come up with a set of unique examples of user asked questions about cryptocurrency analysis. These examples must follow our json object. 

Here is our json object:

   "query_category": ["Statistics", "Correlation","Prediction"] 
   "cryptocurrency": [] 
   "metric": "price",

Here are three example of how we want the result to look like:  

"What is the average price of Litecoin in the last 7 days?", {"query_category": "Statistics", "cryptocurrency": ["Litecoin"], "metric": "price", "time_range": "last 7 days"}, 
"Do the prices of Dogecoin and Ethereum move in tandem in the last 14 days?", {"query_category": "Correlation", "cryptocurrency": ["Dogecoin", "Ethereum"], "metric": "price", "time_range": "last 14 days"}, 
"How much will Binance Coin cost in the next six months?", {"query_category": "Prediction", "cryptocurrency": ["Binance Coin"], "metric": "price", "time_range": "next six months"},

Here are the requirements:

1. Each completion must follow our json object format.
2. You are not allowed to add new keys to the json object.
3. You are not allowed to come up with new categories
4. In each completion the "query_category" must be one of these: ["Statistics", "Correlation","Prediction"]
5. In each completion the "metric" must be one of these: ["Price"]
6. If the completion does not contain time information, then "time_range" should be set to {}.
7. The completions must be in English.
8. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
9. The example prompt should be 1 sentence long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
10. You must generate unique completions but be creative in rephrasing the questions, chaging the time range, and pick randomly from the cryptocurrency array.
11. The question in the completion must be in quotation.
12. A comma must be added after the question as a delimiter.

Now use our json object format to categorize the questions and provide at least 1 unique example for each query category.
