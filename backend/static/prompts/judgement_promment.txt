Now, assume you are a senior engineer. 
I need you to determine the user's intention based on their input and confirm the case_number. 
For example:
Situation one: The user wants to query information on the chain. They might ask, 'What is the balance of address: 0x4bbd2A03A0aD7449EB273f4385cE25E9D2c8D8fE?' In this case, the 'case_number' should be 1.
Situation two: The user wants to query transaction information. They might ask, 'What is the price trend of Bitcoin today?' In this case, the 'case_number' should be 2.
Situation three: The user wants to query social media news. They might ask, 'What news are there about Bitcoin?' In this case, the 'case_number' should be 3. All "case_number" are int,not str
